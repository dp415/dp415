Hello fellow humans and various computerized intelligences, my name is Dave, and I love computer science.
I am using GitHub as it seems to be the future, and the contemporary tool for collaborative projects. I use Git, but have not had the opportunity to work with a team.
I hope to design some personal projects using this service, and I hope to explore technologies related to modern Full Stack Engineering.

I am currently exploring and building a portfolio using Linux (Ubuntu Server has become my preference), Kubernetes, Docker containers, Uvicorn/Gunicorn, Flask/Django, MongoDB/PostgreSQL, Vue JS, Typescript, and Sass.
There is more that I would like to explore, like big data and AI related data organization tools, but full stack engineering is very interesting to me.

I am currently earning my Associates Degree in Automotive Technology in my spare time, and I love it. Working outside of a chair has been relieving for me, and I love being in a shop.

On my personal history...
I started my love affair with computers back in 1992, when I began hacking away at my mother's old work computers (she brought home an IBM DOS machine, and an old Apple from Merrill Lynch). I learned the basics of filesystems, OS configuration, keyboard shortcuts, compatibility, kid pix, document processing, and the internet with these machines. It took until I was 18 to start building systems with directions, and I started with Flash, Dreamweaver, and Coldfusion, before they were purchased by Adobe.

My projects initially drove me into web management, Linux administration, MySQL, PHP, Javascript, and eventually, into creating non-web related programs. This helped me organize team projects in college, and facilitate data collection. My next stage of development was through Java and C++, when I received a formal education in computer science, and this led me into Python. Since then, Python has become my most used language, and I have used it to build data models, accurately calculate statistical data, and present such data, utilizing numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and Decimal. I have also interacted with several services utilizing Python/PHP/Javascript, including CoinbaseProAPI, Twilio, and Square SDK.

My most recent projects have required me to utilize the Javascript Addon SDK for Firefox. I also have fun doing Arduino projects.

I hope to work on EV vehicles in the future, and I hope that I can develop software that can help everyone with the transition to fossile fuel alternatives.
